# hello-world
Honour to the old tradition that is HELLO WORLD

I'm a bullet riddled tank with a new coat of armor
I'm a monster in disguise and I came here to conquer
like a really shitty car turned into a transformer
Ohohoh I'm a transformer

I'm a tiny scared puppy in the shape of a pitbull
I'm a fire breeding dragon with my neck in a shackle
I need to morph into one because my paint start to crackle
Ohohoh I'm a transformer
